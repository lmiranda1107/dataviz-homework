# Pyber Ride Sharing Analysis

## Visible Trends
1. Based on the scatterplot, there seems to be an overall direct relationship between driver count and number of rides per city. Given that the size of the circles in the scatter plot correlates with the driver count per city, one can see that in Urban areas there are significantly more drivers available and therefore more rides to offer to customers. In comparison with Rural areas where the plots are significantly smaller (indicating low driver count) and there are also less number if rides reported. 

2. Rural areas - there is an important distinction to make for Rural areas given that there is a low count of drivers per city and the fare costs are above average in comparison to other city types. A few variables can account for this relationship between driver volume and fare cost such as: 
  - Population (Is there a significant amount of people in those areas that would use these services?, 
  - Demand, 
  - Public transportation usage (are people using other methods of transportation more?), 
  - Distance between places (the more miles to travel, the higher the fare?), etc. 

Typically the combination of high demand and low supply (excess demand) drives prices up and this will not change unless supply catches up with demand. This could help explain the difference; however, additional research would need to be conducted in order to determine other variables that are likely to cause this difference.

3. In Urban areas there is a noticeable difference in volume of rides compared to Suburban and Rural areas. Urban areas tend to have the highest number of rides and drivers per city but also the lowest fares. The concept mentioned above applies similarly to this case, given that the demand and supply are both high, the prices are probably low because there is too much competition. However, this can also be due to some of the same variables mentioned before such as: distance between places, population, socioeconomic status, etc.
